# MBTI Personality Prediction using Machine Learning
## Introduction
The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personalities based on four dimensions, namely: Introversion (I) - Extroversion (E), Intuition (N) - Sensing (S), Thinking (T) - Feeling (F), Judging (J) - Perceiving (P). MBTI is widely used by companies, recommendation systems, and other research domains. Researchers widely use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to predict personality and psychological traits from digital records. In this project, I have developed a MBTI personality classifier that uses machine learning models to predict a personâ€™s personality based on the 50 recent social media posts per user as input.
